## Recommended Tools

### i18n Tools

This plugin uses a variable to store the text domain used when internationalizing strings throughout the site. To take advantage of this method, there are tools that are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:

* [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)
* [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)
* [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)

Any of the above tools should provide you with the proper tooling to internationalize the plugin.
